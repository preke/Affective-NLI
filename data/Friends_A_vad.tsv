And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)  Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.  Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.  I got it from your maid.

Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? Well, only if you order stuff.	  What are you crazy? That's a baby!  Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.  Well, only if you order stuff.	  I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.  That's nice.  No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.  Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.  Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.  He should take the sack?  Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.  Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.  Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room?
